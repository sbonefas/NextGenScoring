# NextGenScoring
The Stat Crew System for Basketball, the current software used by the UW Athletic Department to score basketball games, is extremely outdated and obsolete (it cannot run on Window operating systems past XP). The purpose of this project is to develop a modern replacement to the software which can be used via a web application. Our program allows scorekeepers to document all relevant statistics related to the game being played, and then export it to both a file which the stadiumâ€™s scoreboards reference, as well as any external media sources which are following the game. 

# Installation
To run NextGenScoring, you must first download Node.js and install Electron. Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). To make sure it is installed, run

> node -v

Once you have Node downloaded, install Electron and other dependencies using npm by running

> npm install Electron

Install nyc for code coverage metrics
> npm install nyc

Install filereader
> npm install filereader

To prepare for the frontend tests, 
- Download Python 3.6.4 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- Download Mozilla Firefox 57.0 [here](https://filehippo.com/download_firefox/79535/) 
- Install geckodriver 0.20.0 [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) 
- Edit your environmental variables to ensure that your computer can find the geckodriver. (As an example, the geckodriver.exe file is in my C:\Users\neu3\bin folder, and C:\Users\neu3\bin\geckodriver.exe is in my Path user variable) 
This link can help add something to your PATH variable: [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)
- Once python is installed, to install Selenium in the terminal run
> pip install selenium

# Usage and Testing
Due to an unexpected issue between Selenium and Electron, our frontend tests are not able to be ran alongside the backend and integration tests. 

To run the frontend tests, in the "NextGenScoring" directory, run the Python scripts with:
> python frontend\ tests/name_of_file.py 

To run our backend tests, run

> npm test

This will run our entire backend test suite and provide pass/fail messages along with code coverage statistics.

To manually use the software without running any test scripts, run

> npm start

This should lead you to a login page asking for a password,
